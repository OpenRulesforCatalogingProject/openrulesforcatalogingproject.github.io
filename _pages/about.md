# Vision

Free and open cataloging guidelines for the library community with
practical examples and easily understood models created by catalogers to
empower catalogers.

# Scope

The Open Rules for Cataloging (ORC) project supports the cataloging
community in a pragmatic and freely available manner while adhering to
cataloging ethics and established best practices. The ORC Core Committee
endeavors to create guidelines and models that are straightforward,
comprehensible, and inclusive to all types of library communities. ORC
guidelines and models strive to be compatible with shared cataloging
environments to allow for broad usage. The guidelines cover general
description of library materials for use primarily in (but not limited
to) a MARC-based environment.

Cataloging principles are no longer siloed to the library. Due to
changing library metadata environments and assets, these practices must
be interoperable among wider technology platforms. ORC seeks to be a
standard that will bridge data exchange and encourage metadata creation
and reuse.

The focus of ORC is on bibliographic resources as commonly encountered
in school, public and academic libraries. Currently the project is
developing cataloging guidelines for non-rare monographs and will
develop guidelines for other formats if needed by the community. Because
the main aim of this project is to fill gaps in freely accessible
cataloging codes, there are no plans to develop rules for formats that
already have freely available guidelines.
