## 020100. Edition statement (repeatable)

**Definition:** A word or phrase that describes or labels the difference between editions of a resource, and may contain a statement of responsibility. Edition statements may contain ordinal numbers (example: 3rd or third) and words such as “edition,” “update,” “version,” or their equivalents in other languages. 

- Source: BIBFRAME “[Edition statement](https://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe.html#p_editionStatement){:target="_blank"}\.”

**Rule:** Transcribe the edition statement. If a resource does not bear an edition statement but is known to be a distinct edition, record it and add a note for justification. Edition information may be found on an outside source, such as the publisher's website or catalog.
