A Title is the name by which a resource is known, typically assigned by
the creator or publisher. Titles may have variations due to
translations, abbreviations, placement on the item, or multiple parts.

## 010100. Title proper (not repeatable)

Definition: The Title proper is the name of the resource being cataloged. An
alternative title---a second or additional title connected to the main
title using words like "or" or equivalent script in another
language---is part of the Title proper.

-   Source: Universal principle expressed in current cataloging codes; [ALA 1908 rules](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015033881775&view=1up&seq=17){:target="_blank"} (p. xiii, 43); 
BIBFRAME \"[Title](https://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe.html#p_title){:target="_blank"}\"; 
[ISBD 2021 1.1.3.4](https://repository.ifla.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/202c522c-82e9-41ae-ab7c-d7227070142c/content){:target="_blank"}.

**Rule:** Transcribe the Title proper.
Retain the word order, spelling, and punctuation, following [ISBD
2021 1.A-J](https://repository.ifla.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/202c522c-82e9-41ae-ab7c-d7227070142c/content){:target="_blank"}
as appropriate. Retain any numbers or part names associated with
multipart monographs. Provide a transliteration of the Title proper if it
differs from the script of the language of the cataloging agency, such
as Cyrillic into a Romanized form. If the Title proper is ambiguous, include
additional information in square brackets. Symbols that cannot be
reproduced with Unicode characters can be written out where appropriate
or necessary, following conventions found in [LCRI 1.0E](https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcri01_0e.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

If a resource does not bear a title or if it is a compilation with no
collective title, supply a Title proper found on an outside source, such as the
publisher's website; if no title can be found then the cataloger may
create one, following [ISBD 2021 1.A-J](https://repository.ifla.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/202c522c-82e9-41ae-ab7c-d7227070142c/content){:target="_blank"}
and/or local practice. Add a note specifying the source if the Title proper is
not found on the resource.

If a title is preceded by an introductory statement or phrase, do not
include it in the Title proper. If a title includes a grammatically
linked statement of responsibility, include it in the Title proper.

## 010200. Parallel title proper (repeatable)

**Definition:** The Parallel title proper is one or more titles in another language and/or script
from the same source of information as the Title proper.

-   Source: BIBFRAME \"[ParallelTitle](https://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe.html#c_ParallelTitle){:target="_blank"}.\"

**Rule:** If the resource being cataloged has titles in two or more
languages, select as the Title proper the one representing the language
of the majority of the work. If no majority can be determined, select as
the Title proper the one in the language of the cataloging agency or the
one most appropriate to the user community. Transcribe all Parallel
titles proper deemed necessary. Optionally, add variant title fields for
Parallel titles proper if deemed important for discovery.

that contains the remainder of the title after the Title proper.

-   Source: BIBFRAME "[Subtitle](https://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe.html#p_subtitle){:target="_blank"}.\"

phrases using an ellipsis.

**Rule:** Transcribe the Statement of responsibility as it appears on
the resource. If a single name appears, transcribe it. If more than one name
appears, the cataloger may decide how many (or how few) names to record

terms or essential identifying words. If a Statement of responsibility
is grammatically linked to the title, record it as part of the Title
proper and do not repeat it. If the relationship between the Title  proper and
Statement of responsibility is not clear, the cataloger can supply a
bracketed phrase for clarity. Follow [ISBD 2021 1.A-J](https://repository.ifla.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/202c522c-82e9-41ae-ab7c-d7227070142c/content){:target="_blank"}
